title: Arrange Mode
---

Drafts unique arrange mode is a quick way to work with text as individual lines (separated by a line feed) or block (separated by two line feeds). Lines or blocks can be reordered by drag and drop, duplicated, deleted or edited in place.

Arrange mode can be opened for the entire content of the current draft from the arrange mode button at the bottom of the screen, or from a text selection within the draft. Arrange mode can also be used as a service from other apps via URL scheme, or triggered by a script.

Once in arrange mode, individual blocks or lines can be reordering using drag and drop. Swipe to the left or right on lines to expose additional options - such as duplication. Text in lines can also be edited inline in arrange mode to make a quick fix or change to the text.

While in arrange mode, no changes are saved until the "Done" button is pressed.
