{% include back.html title="Editor" path="/editor" %}

When editing, an additional row of keyboard commands is displayed above the on-screen keyboard. This row displays actions defined in action groups marked with the "Show as keyboard" settings. [Action groups article](/actions/actiongroups) contains details on configuring groups, and [configuring actions](/actions/actions) discussing controlling the appearance of the action in the keyboard.

Although any action can be run from the keyboard row, action groups used as keyboards are typically configured with editing commands to manipulate text, more the cursor, or insert special formatting or characters.

To the left of the keyboard row, appears a keyboard selection icon which indicates the currently selected action group. Tapping it opens a keyboard selection view, with quick access to available keyboards and command buttons for [find and replace](/editor/find), [arrange mode](/editor/arrangemode), action group editing, and to toggle visibility of the keyboard row.

**TIP:** _You can also quickly switch the active action group in the keyboard by swiping up or down on the keyboard row itself._

To the right of the keyboard row is a downward arrow button which ends editing dimissing the keyboard.

In the middle are the actions for the selected action group - simply tap one to run the action. If more actions than fit are available, the keyboard row can be scrolled side to side.
