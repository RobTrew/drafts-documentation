title: Focus Mode
---

Newly introduced in Drafts 5, focus mode changes two key Drafts behaviors to let you focus on a particular on-going project, or to more easily process a collection of drafts. Focus mode is enabled and disabled using the focus mode button in the lower left of the editor, or in settings. When in focus mode, these two changes occur:

1. The "Create new draft" setting is disabled. Draft will always return to the last edited draft, rather than creating a new one when you return to the app after the specified period of time.
2. If an action which uses the [after success](%20site.baseurl%20/actions/advancedsettings) to move draft to the archive or trash is used, the next draft in the current draft list filter will be loaded, as if the next button were pressed, rather than creating a new draft.

In combination, these change make it easy to focus on a particular draft if you are doing on-going research, etc., and also make it easy to focus on processing a series of drafts one after the other without having to navigate the draft list to find the next unprocessed draft.
