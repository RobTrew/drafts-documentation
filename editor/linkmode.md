title: Link Mode

{% include back.html title="Editor" path="/editor" %}

Link mode turns URLs, email addresses, phone numbers and physical addresses into tappable links. Drafts identifies most common link types, highlights them and performs the default action for that link when it is tapped â€“ such as offering to call a phone number, or opening a web link in Safari.

As in Safari, long press on a link will open a menu of additional options for the link.

While in link mode, editing is disabled.
