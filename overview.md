This list covers key changes and updates in Drafts 5 for those familiar with earlier versions.

#### Draft Storage and Organization

- **Tagging**. Assign multiple tags to drafts to help stay organized. Tags can be used to filter the draft list and queries - for all inbox, archives, flagged drafts - creating project workspaces.
- **Filtering**. The inbox, archive, flagged and trash folder can be filtered by one or more tags, or to display untagged drafts to create virtual workspaces for projects.
- **Focus mode**. One of Drafts key feature is always opening to a new draft, but sometimes it's useful to temporarily disable new draft creation when you are working on a longer draft, or processing a series of drafts. When focus mode is enabled, will always return to the last edited draft, and "After success" actions will open the next draft rather than a new one, to allow quickly processing a series of drafts without having to re-open them one at a time from the draft list.
- **Next-Previous navigation**. Via buttons or keyboard shortcuts, easily move to the next or previous draft for quick processing.
- **More control over the draft list**. Display just title, extended previews, last run action, or not. Your choice.
- **More efficient, fast iCloud sync**. Sync has now been expanded to many user settings as well.

#### Editor and Interface

- **All new editor** with better theming and more syntax highlighting options. Syntax highlighting is selectable per draft for Markdown, Plain text, Taskpaper and Javascript - with more syntaxes planned.
- **Multiple extended keyboards**. Keyboard configuration has been integrate into actions. Any action group can be displayed on the extended keyboard, and you can quickly select between multiple keyboard rows by swiping up-down on row.
- **App-wide themes and alternate app icons**.
- **Detailed control over text editing options**. Adjust margins, line height, line numbering, auto-correct, smart quotes/dashes, and more.
- **Tappable [x] / [ ] task check marks**.
- **Pin draft or action lists on iPad**. If you prefer to keep open draft or action list, you can.
- **Find and replace**. In draft find and replace, including regular expression support.
- **Expanded external keyboard support**. Better app navigation and, as always, customizable, assignable hot keys for actions.
- **Improved arrange mode**. Arranging selected lines, or arranging by blocks or lines.

#### Actions

- **Dramatically enhanced scripting capabilities**. Query and update drafts, read and write files, integrate with web services (HTTP requests), generate reminders and events and more.
- **Improved support for Workflow and Callback URL**. New action steps can wait for results from callback URLs or Workflow, and incorporate those results in the action.
- **Support for multiple accounts**. Actions can target different accounts for integrated OAuth services like Twitter, Google and Dropbox.
- **New Action Directory**. Significantly improved sharing of actions through the Action Directory. The directory now supports updating and removing your shared items, and posting of action groups and well as individual actions.

#### Apple Watch

- **Add/remove tags from drafts**
- **Flag and unflag drafts**
- **Siri support** "Create a note using Drafts", etc.

#### General

- All new, smoother user-interface.
- **Siri integration**. Trigger capture in drafts with Siri, using phrases like "Create a note using Drafts", "Dictate a note with Drafts".
- **Extensive drag and drop support**. Including support for dragging text from anywhere and dropping directly on an action in the action list to run an action.
