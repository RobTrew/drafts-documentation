{% include back.html title="Getting Started" path="/gettingstarted" %}

*New to Drafts? You might want to [start at the home page](/). This page intended to a answer questions existing users of Drafts 4 may have about the Drafts 5 release.*

### The Business Bits

- **Drafts 5 is being released as a new app**. Drafts 5 will not replace Drafts 4, but install along side it. Drafts 5 can migrate drafts, actions and keyboard customizations from Drafts 4.
- **Drafts 4 will continue to be supported and available**. Drafts 4 will remain in the store and be supported at this time. We hope you love all the great new feature in Drafts 5 and want to upgrade, but know not everyone want to jump on the latest thing right away. People can choose to migrate to Drafts 5 if and when they feel they are ready.
- **Drafts 5 will be a free download**. Drafts 5 will be a free download, with a generous feature set. The free version is a great way to test drive Drafts 5, and will offer full support for creating, editing, syncing of drafts and built-in actions.
- **Drafts Pro** Advanced features and customizations will be available as part of the optional *Drafts Pro* subscription. This include themes, custom icons, editing of actions, saving workspaces and more. [Full details](/draftspro).
- *We hope to bring Drafts to the Mac*. A lot of work has been done in the Drafts 5 development cycle to prepare the app to move to the Mac, but we do not have anything to announce at this time.

### Editor and Interface

- **New Editor**. The Drafts editor has been updated with more advanced [theming and granular control of editor settings](/editor/appearance), and support for more syntax highlighting options, selectable per draft.

- **[More themes and alternate app icons](/editor/appearance)**. {% include pro.html %} Themes now is not just for the editor, but throughout the app, with more options, including Solarized and pure black themes.
- **[Detailed control over text editing options](/editor/appearance)**. Adjust margins, line height, line numbering, auto-correct, smart quotes/dashes, and more.
- [**Tappable [x] / [ ] task check marks.**](/editor/tasks)

### Draft Storage and Organization

- **[Tagging](/drafts/tagging)**. Assign multiple tags to drafts to help stay organized. Tags can be used to filter the draft list and queries - for all inbox, isArchived, flagged drafts - creating project workspaces.
- **[Filtering and List Options](/drafts/listoptions)**. The inbox, archive, flagged and trash folder can be filtered by one or more tags, or display untagged drafts to create virtual workspaces for projects. Multiple workspaces can be save and retrieved.
- **[Workspaces](/drafts/workspaces)**. {% include pro.html %}
- **[Focus mode](/editor/focusmode)**. One of Drafts key feature is always opening to a new draft, but sometimes it's useful to temporarily disable new draft creation when you are working on a longer draft, or processing a series of drafts. When focus mode is enabled, will always return to the last edited draft, and "After success" actions will open the next draft rather than a new one, to allow quickly processing a series of drafts without having to re-open them one at a time from the draft list.
- **Next-Previous navigation**. Via buttons or keyboard shortcuts, easily move to the next or previous draft for quick processing.
- **More efficient, fast iCloud sync**. Sync has now been expanded to many user settings as well.
- **[Automated Backup](/settings/backups)**. On-demand or automated periodic backup of drafts and action groups to iCloud Drive.

### Actions

- **Dramatically enhanced scripting capabilities**. Query and update drafts, read and write files, integrate with web services (HTTP requests), generate reminders and events and more.
- **[Multiple Account Support and Credentials System](/settings/credentials)**. Most services integrated with Drafts now support multiple accounts â€“ including Twitter, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive. Have home and work accounts? No problem.
- **Improved support for Workflow and Callback URL**. New action steps can wait for results from callback URLs or Workflow, and incorporate those results in the action.
- **[New Action Steps](/actions/steps/)**: WebDAV support, Insert text, with more coming.
- **[New Action Directory](/actions/actiondirectory)**. Significantly improved sharing of actions through the Action Directory. The directory now supports updating and removing your shared items, and posting of action groups and well as individual actions.

### What's Missing

- **Some action steps and service integrations that were in Drafts 4 are not in Drafts 5**: In some cases the same functionality can still be integrated. Some of these may return to Drafts 5 as direct integrations, but they are not there at the moment. These include:
  - *Box*: Files can be created, append and prepend to Box using the new WebDAV action step and [Box's WebDAV support](https://community.box.com/t5/Upload-and-Download-Files-and/WebDav-with-Box/ta-p/310), or via Export steps and the File.app Box integration. There is not currently a "Box" dedicated action step.
  - *Event action step*: Calendar events can be create via scripting, or third party app integrations (like Fantastical), but there is not currently an equivalent to the Drafts 4 "Event" action.
  - *Path and Google Plus*: These social media networks no longer have dedicated action steps.
- **iMessages app is not available**: We are likely to restore this functionality soon, but the iMessages app was not ready in time for the initial release.
