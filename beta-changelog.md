title: Changelog – Beta Version
---

#### v0.9.1.4

- **Change:** If we're reasonably sure you are going to complete a side panel reveal gesture, go ahead and dismiss the keyboard rather than waiting until the gesture completes.
- **New:** Work on onboarding improvements.
- **New:** Credentials settings screen empty states.
- **Change:** Lots of work you won't see on finalizing IAP flows.

#### v0.9.1.3

- **Change:** Reworked handling of buttons in Trash a bit.  You can no longer select drafts in Trash, "Operations" button changes to "Empty Trash" when trash is selected, and if a filter/workspace is active, you get the option to only empty the current drafts from the trash, or empty all.
- **New:** Ability to import from Drafts 4 export files.  Allows for more granular migration, if some one only wants to import inbox, for example.  This means the D4 "Drafts Export" option can "Open in" D5 now and go directly to import.

- **Change:** Better responsiveness to Dynamic Type size changes while app is running.
- **Change:** Relabelling some values in action step configuration to better clarity, especially around credentials.
- **Fix:** Caught another edge case in sync that is hard to explain. :-)

#### v0.9.1.2

- **New:** Run Drafts 4 Action step. Takes template and action name, and executes in Drafts 4 via callback. Useful for step types not currently supported in Drafts 5.
- **Change:** Using the "Drafts 5: Add as callback" migration option from Drafts 4 will generate an action which uses the new "Run Drafts 4 action" step.
- **Change:** A few tweaks hoping to eliminate the issue where the checkboxes do not appear when entering select mode in draft and action lists.
- **Fix:** Prevent sidebar gestures from triggering when text selection is changing.
- **Fix:** Case where lost network connection could leave sync paused until the app restarted.
- **Fix:** Improve tap zones for Select/Operations buttons.

#### v0.9.1.1

- **Change:** Settings for visibility and display mode of tabs in both drafts and action lists are now in the "..." menus.

#### v0.1.1.81

- **New:** Action group icons.  All your groups will have the default icon to start.

- **New:** "After success" now has an additional "Ask" option, which will prompt after running the action and ask if you want to archive, trash or skip.
- **New:** Add visual indicator of key action presses. Probably needs a spinner but fades the key while the action is running for now.
- **New:** Along with latest Drafts 4 beta, support for "Drafts 5: Add as Callback" migration, accessed from Action edit screen in Drafts 4. This is for actions that cannot be directly migrated to Drafts 5, and creates an action in Drafts 5 which calls the Drafts 4 action as a callback URL.
- **Change:** Rename `editor.focus()` to `editor.activate()` to avoid confusion with focus mode.  Old method still works for now, but will be phased out.

    - It's not pretty or complete, but it works (I hope...you are suppose to confirm that)
    - It now supports sharing of Action Groups as well as individual actions.
    - It now supports updating and/or removing items you have shared. No account needed, each share is tracked with individual secrets synced in your iCloud account. This allows quick fixes for typos, or bug fix updates to shared actions without loosing the unique URL.
    - *No, I don't need to hear about the lack of search, or discoverability, etc.* Just test that sharing, modifying, removing and install of actions and groups works, please.

- **Fix:** If a /runAction URL was used to call an action with an "After success" disposition of Archive or Trash, the text would get saved as a draft, not forgotten as intended.
- **New:** `app.selectDraft();` method. Opens UI to select a draft - same UI as Share extension selection for appending - and returns the draft object selected (or nil if cancelled). [Docs](https://github.com/agiletortoise/drafts-documentation/wiki/App)

- **Change:** If background email generates blank body, add a space to prevent Mailgun error.

#### v0.1.1.47

- **New:** Watch app. I have some other plans for it, but it is currently a port of the updated D4 watch app. Not super well tested, but I think it mostly works. Going to run it through the paces myself this weekend.  Will circle back on it and add Siri and some other planned features soon.  I made a couple UI flips just to make it distinguishable from the D4 watch app.

- **Change:** Open valid links in HTML Previews using Safari View Controller instead of the preview window itself.

#### v0.1.1.45

- **Change:** Action groups and action export files are now in compressed binary format. This works better for sharing, downloading, etc. - in addition to being a space-saver for backups, etc. - and users don't get confronted with a wall of JSON which scares them. At least that's what I'm hoping.  Still need to test more.
- **Change:** Port D4's RTL language support.
- **New:** Template tag helper keyboard row. Probably not done yet, but it's something.
- **New:** Include Action step type. Works like the D4 version.
- **New:** Draft script object "languageGrammar" property to read/write the preferred syntax for the draft.

- **Fix:** Action group backup was being a bit too agressive about ensuring the safety of your Action Groups.

- **New:** Work on the on-boarding process.  If you delete and reinstall you will get the first launch experience. Design is not done, but it will on-board an initial set of actions and keys now.  The on-boarding sets up a "Basic" actions group with some common actions, and also loops over a set of actions for popular apps (like OmniFocus, Fantastical, Things, Tweetbot, Ulysses, etc.) and sets up actions in the Basic list for those apps *IF* the user has that app installed on the device.  This process updates status in iCloud, so the groups will not be re-created on a new install if the user already has been through it on another device, or in a previous install.
