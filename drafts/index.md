title: Managing Drafts
---

Drafts are organized and accessed using the draft list sidebar, which can be displayed by swiping to the right, or tapping the draft icon in the upper left.

Drafts has a lightweight organization system similar to email. Individual drafts are created in the "Inbox". When a draft has been processed, it can be moved to the Archive to long term storage or the Trash if it no longer needed. Drafts can also, optionally, be flagged and have any number of tags assigned to it.

The draft list is organized into four tabs:

- **Inbox**: New drafts are created in the inbox.
- **Flagged**: Optionally, drafts can be flagged. A flag is a separate property of a draft, so flagged drafts can reside in either the inbox or archive.
- **Archive**: Meant for long term storage of drafts no longer actively is use.
- **Trash**: The trash is where drafts go to be deleted. The trash can be emptied manually, but a drafts will be permanently deleted if it has been in the trash for more than 7 days.
