Drafts includes an iMessages app which allows you to use Drafts as a repository of text snippets to quickly insert into Message conversations. Great if you have those favorite ASCII art tidbits, emoji sequences or more professional answers you need to send repeatedly.

To use the Messages app, tap the Drafts icon in the Message app selection window. Tap the filter button to show only drafts with a certain tag, browse inbox, flagged or archive tabs - or search for a draft.

Once you find the draft, tap it in the list to insert the text into the message window, ready to send.  The "Send" button must still be tapped to complete sending the message.
