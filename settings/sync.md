Drafts syncs across devices and backs up data to iCloud. Information synchronized to iCloud include:

- Drafts
- Draft version history
- Actions and action groups
- Logs of actions performed
- Settings and configuration options, including editor options
- Credentials for services

If an iCloud account is available when Drafts is installed, sync is enabled automatically.
Even if you only have Drafts installed on a single device, it is highly recommended you leave iCloud sync active to protect your data so it could be restored in a new installation.

iCloud options are available in Settings > iCloud.  If you ever have trouble with sync, it is recommended you visit this area and enable the sync log, which can be sent directly to support from this screen.
