Much of the power for Drafts resides in actions. Actions are can be used to export to other apps and services, to send messages and email â€“ but also for simple things like inserting text.

An action consists of one or more [action steps](/actions/steps/) which do the actual work of the action, but also has basic configuration options and settings covered in this article.

To edit an action, swipe to the right on an action in the action list and select "Edit".
