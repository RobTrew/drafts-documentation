{% include back.html title="Actions" path="/actions" %}

Actions are organized in action groups. At any time, a single action group is loaded into the action list, and one loaded as the active keyboard in the [extended keyboard](/editor/keyboard).

To access groups, swipe to the left in the action list, or tap the title of the current group at the top of the list, and groups slide out from the side Tap on a group in the group list to load it in the action list.

### Managing Groups

Some aspects of an action group can be modified directly in the action list when a group is loaded. Actions can be reordered by drag and drop and edited by swiping to the right on an action - but more detailed group editing is done in the group management view.

Tap "Manage" in the group list, or use the edit button in the keyboard selection window to open the groups management window.  Here groups can be created and edited.
