title: Action Step â€“ HTML Preview
---

{% include back.html title="Action Steps" path="/actions/steps" %}

Opens an in-app browser displaying the content of an HTML template. Commonly used for Markdown previews, but can display any HTML generated by the template or a script.

#### Examples

- [Dark-Light Preview](http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Ct)
- [Stats](http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1DY)

#### Options

- **Template**: The template should output a complete HTML document for display. Linking to external CSS, etc., is fully supported.

#### Built-in Templates

There are three options to set a default template on an HTML preview step. Each of these styles (Basic, Swiss, Foghorn) are configured to do Markdown conversion of current draft and display in a basic HTML wrapper suitable for most Markdown preview needs.
