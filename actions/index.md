In Drafts, actions are commands used to output to other services and apps, manipulate the text in drafts, and much more.  They can take many forms, from simple helper actions that insert text or special characters, to full-blown integrations with web services to output text.

Drafts ships with a default set of actions. There are also many ready-to-use actions which can installed from the [Action Directory]({{ site.baseurl }}/actions/actiondirectory). [Drafts Pro]({{ site.baseurl }}/draftspro) users can also create and edit actions.

Each action consists of one or more action steps.  Details of available step types are below.
